# Chess_Engine

A (work in progress) Chess engine utilizing pygame in Python3!

This project, which I started as a final for INFO_TC 4401 at the University of Missouri, allows players at the same screen to play a game of chess.
Output sent to the screen comes in the form of rank/file moves as they are made on the board. The notation doesn't provide insight into the specific
pieces being moved, as is the standard for chess notation, but it does provide a rudimentary means of understanding moves that are made. In its
current state, the game is able to understand if a move is valid or not, and castling/promotion are supported. Right now I'm working on implementing
check/checkmate detection, and hope to eventually add more functionality regarding things such as the game interface, AI adversaries, and more. I'm
also working on finding ways to make my code more concise, and in turn more powerful.

Thanks for taking the time to check this out!
